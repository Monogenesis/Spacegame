# Spacegame

A 2D spaceshooter written in Java, completly made from scratch.

## Motivation

Due to my great interest in game development and my limited knowledge of computer languages at that time (only Java), I wanted to build a game from scratch by myself. Accompanied by trial and error, tutorials and readings, this little space shooter was created. Gradually I realized how complex the development of even a small game can be and how important programming paradigms and design patterns are.
